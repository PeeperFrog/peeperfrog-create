---

# 1. Infographics, Data Visualizations, Charts, and Graphs

- The model won't calculate real data, you need to find, verify and supply it. 
- Gemini models are uniquely good at rendering legible text. Use this to your advantage by specifying the "flow" of information.
- Specify the type of chart and the labels for the X and Y axes.
- Define the sections (e.g., "three-step process") and explicitly state the headers you want.
- Example 1: "A 3D isometric bar chart showing 'Revenue Growth' from 2020 to 2025. Modern glassmorphism style, vibrant purple gradients, clean numerical labels on the side."
- Example 2: "An infographic on the water cycle with three sections: Evaporation, Condensation, and Precipitation. Clean vector style, blue and teal color palette, bold legible titles."

## 1A. Comparative "Versus" Infographics

- Perfect for "This vs. That" scenarios or feature comparisons.
- Specify a "split-screen" layout and label both sides clearly.
- Example: "A side-by-side comparison infographic: 'Remote Work vs. Office Work.' Left side in blue, right side in orange. Use icons for 'Commute,' 'Flexibility,' and 'Socializing' with bold headings."

## 1B. Circular Process / Cycle Diagrams

- Ideal for repeating workflows or "feedback loops."
- Request a "radial" or "circular" flow and count the number of steps.
- Example: "A 5-step circular flow diagram showing the 'Product Lifecycle.' Clean vector icons for each stage: Concept, Design, Build, Test, Launch. Soft pastel colors, professional sans-serif font."

## 1C. Exploded View / Anatomical Schematics

- Great for showing how a complex object is built.
- Use the term "exploded view" and ask for "leader lines" (the lines pointing to parts).
- Example: "An exploded view diagram of a high-end mechanical keyboard. Floating layers showing the keycaps, switches, PCB, and case. Clean leader lines with text labels for each component."

## 1D. Gantt Charts & Timelines

- Visualizing project management or historical events.
- Define the X-axis (time) and the Y-axis (tasks/phases).
- Example: "A horizontal project timeline chart for a 6-month software launch. Color-coded bars for 'Research,' 'Development,' and 'QA.' Clean dates along the bottom, modern corporate style."

## 1E. Funnel / Pyramid Visualizations

- Useful for sales funnels, hierarchy of needs, or demographic breakdowns.
- Specify the number of "tiers" and the direction (upright or inverted).

- Example: "A 4-tier marketing funnel diagram. Labels from top to bottom: 'Awareness,' 'Interest,' 'Decision,' 'Action.' Vibrant gradient colors, 3D layered glass effect, white text."

## 1F. Statistical "Fact Sheet" Dashboards

- A dense collection of data points, icons, and big numbers.
- Ask for "cards" or "modules" to keep the data organized.
- Example: "A data dashboard fact sheet about 'Global Solar Energy.' Feature one large '85%' statistic, a small line graph, and four modular icons with sub-text. Tech-blue and charcoal color palette."

## 1G. Mind Maps & Brainstorming Clouds

- For showing interconnected ideas or "spider" diagrams.
- Define the "central node" and the "branching" style.

- Example: "A colorful mind map with a central hub labeled 'AI Innovation.' Multiple branches leading to 'Healthcare,' 'Ethics,' 'Education,' and 'Robotics.' Hand-drawn marker style on a clean white background."

## 1H. Heatmaps & Geographical Data Maps

- Visualizing density or regional statistics.
- Specify the region (e.g., World Map) and the "color scale."
- "A stylized world map heatmap showing 'Internet Connectivity.' Dark mode aesthetic, neon green areas for high density, dark gray for low density. Minimalist borders, glowing effect."

## 1I. Step-by-Step "How-To" Pictograms

- Instructional graphics without heavy text, similar to IKEA manuals.
- Best Practice: Use "line art," "numbered steps," and "minimalist silhouettes."
- Example: "A 4-panel instructional pictogram on 'How to Plant a Tree.' Step 1: Dig; Step 2: Place; Step 3: Fill; Step 4: Water. Simple black line art, yellow accent color, no background."

## 1J. Organizational / Flowcharts

- Showing hierarchy or "Yes/No" decision paths.
- Best Practice: Mention "connecting arrows" and "standardized box shapes."
- Example: "A professional logic flowchart for a customer support 'Decision Tree.' Rectangular boxes for actions, diamond boxes for 'Yes/No' questions. Clean connecting arrows, high-contrast black and white."

# 2. Photorealistic Portraits

- For humans, focus on lighting and lens "language" to avoid the "AI plastic" look.
- Mention specific lighting (Rembrandt, softbox) and camera settings like "depth of field."
- Example: "A close-up portrait of an elderly carpenter in his workshop. Natural sunlight through a window, 85mm lens, f/1.8, showing fine skin textures and sawdust in the air."

- The "Portrait" category changes drastically based on the intended "vibe."

## 2A. The Headshot
- Example: "Professional corporate headshot, neutral gray background, soft 3-point lighting, 100mm lens, sharp focus on eyes."

## 2B. The Environmental Portrait
- Example: "A scientist in a high-tech lab, surrounded by glowing equipment, shallow depth of field, cool blue ambient light."

## 2C. The Candid/Street Portrait
- Example: "A close-up of a street musician, motion blur in the background, harsh sunlight, high contrast, 35mm film style."

# 3. Layered Papercraft

- A tactile, physical art style made from "cut paper."
- Use words like "Shadow boxes," "Paper layers," and "Depth."
- Specify Paper Type: Use words like cardstock (stiff), vellum (see-through), crepe paper (wrinkled), or corrugated (ridged).
- Describe the Cut: Are the edges "laser-cut" (perfectly smooth) or "hand-cut with a craft knife" (slightly imperfect)?
- The "Shadow" Rule: Since this is a 3D medium, always define the light. "Top-down lighting" makes it look flat; "Side-lighting" makes the layers pop.

## 3A. The "Shadow Box" (Deep 3D)
- This style mimics a deep wooden frame where the layers are spaced far apart, creating dramatic shadows.
- Mention "distanced layers" and "directional shadows."
- Example: "A 3D shadow box diorama of a deep ocean trench. Multiple layers of navy and teal cardstock, a glowing anglerfish in the deepest layer, harsh side-lighting to emphasize the physical distance between paper cutouts."

## 3B. "Quilling" (Coiled Paper Art)
- Unlike flat layers, quilling uses thin strips of paper rolled and shaped to create intricate patterns.
- Mention "rolled paper strips," "coiled textures," and "on-edge."
- Example: "A portrait of a colorful peacock made entirely of paper quilling. Intricate coils and swirls of vibrant paper strips set on edge, macro photography style, tactile 3D texture, white background."

## 3C. The "Pop-Up Book" (Folding/Structural)
- This style focuses on the creases, folds, and the "hinges" that make paper look like it's springing off a flat surface.
- Mention "center fold," "paper hinges," and "creased edges."
- Example: "A pop-up book style illustration of a medieval castle. The castle appears to be rising out of the center fold of a book, visible paper tabs and hinges, bright folk-art colors, handcrafted aesthetic."

## 3D. Flat-Lay "Paper Collage" (Tactile 2D)
- This is less about deep shadows and more about the texture of the paper itself (torn edges, fiber, grain).
- Mention "torn edges," "paper grain," and "overlapping flat shapes."
- Example: "A flat-lay paper collage of a mountain landscape. Overlapping pieces of textured construction paper, torn deckle edges, visible paper fibers, soft overhead lighting with minimal shadows."

## 3E. Backlit "Lampshade" Style (Glowing)
- This mimics paper lanterns or "light boxes" where the light comes from behind the layers, turning the paper into silhouettes.
- Mention "backlit," "translucent," and "silhouette."
- Example: "A backlit papercraft scene of a forest at night. The sun is a bright light source behind five layers of translucent vellum paper, creating a gradient of silhouettes from light gray to deep black."

# 4. Flat Vector Illustrations

- Commonly used for websites and UI/UX design.
- Use words like "minimalist," "flat color," and "no gradients" to keep it clean.
- Example: "A flat vector illustration of a person drinking coffee while working on a laptop. Minimalist style, muted pastel colors, thick clean lines, white background."

## 4A. Corporate Memphis
- Example: "Modern tech illustration style, elongated limbs, playful proportions, vibrant flat colors, clean geometric shapes."

## 4B. Line Art / Monoline

## 4C. Grainy Retro Vector
- Example: "1950s travel poster style, textured 'noise' overlay, screen-printed aesthetic, limited color palette."

# 5. Architectural & Interior Renders

- Great for mood boards or visualizing a space.
- Define the architectural style (Mid-century modern, Industrial, Brutalist) and the time of day.
- Example: "An interior shot of a Japandi-style living room. Light oak wood, large floor-to-ceiling windows, 'Golden Hour' lighting, cozy minimalist furniture."

Note that the difference between an "artist's impression" and a "technical render" is huge.

## 5A. External "Hero" Shot
- Example: "A glass skyscraper at twilight, 'blue hour' lighting, reflections of city lights, wide-angle architectural photography."

## 5B. Sectional/Dollhouse
- Example: "A 3D cross-section 'dollhouse' view of a modern apartment, showing all rooms at once, isometric perspective, soft overhead lighting."

## 5C. Interior Close-up
- Example: "A 'vignette' of a coffee table with books and a candle, soft focus, tactile fabric textures, cozy hygge aesthetic."

# 6. Cartoons & 3D Characters

- Think Pixar or Dreamworks style.
- Describe the character's expression and the "material" (e.g., "stylized 3D render").
- Example "A cute, grumpy 3D little monster made of blue fur. Large expressive eyes, Pixar-style rendering, high-detail texture, studio lighting."

## 6A. Claymation
- Example:"A character made of molded polymer clay, visible thumbprints, stop-motion aesthetic, studio macro lighting."

## 6B. 2D Cel-Shaded

## 6C. Low-Poly 3D
- Example: "A forest scene in low-poly art style, sharp geometric edges, flat shading, nostalgic N64 aesthetic."

# 7. Cinematic Landscapes

- For epic, wide-angle views.
- Use "Atmospheric perspective" and describe the weather or "mood."
- Example: "A cinematic wide shot of a futuristic cyberpunk city in the rain. Neon signs reflecting in puddles, atmospheric fog, dark moody blues and hot pinks, 8k resolution."

Landscape prompts benefit from "time-period" or "biological" subtypes.

## 7A. Alien/Sci-Fi World
- Example: "Extraterrestrial landscape with two suns, purple vegetation, floating rock formations, iridescent atmosphere."

## 7B. Terrarium/Miniature
- Example: "A tiny forest inside a glass jar, macro perspective, moss and small ferns, soft misty atmosphere inside the glass."

## 7C. Aerial/Satellite
- Example: "A top-down satellite view of a river delta, intricate fractal patterns of water and silt, high-contrast earth tones."

# 8. Typography & Logo Design

- Gemini models handle text well so you can request specific words.
- Put the desired text in "quotation marks" and describe the font style (Serif, Script, Bold).
- Example: "A minimalist logo for a bakery. A simple line-art croissant with the word 'FLOURISH' written underneath in an elegant serif font. Black on white background."

You can also specify the medium of the letters.

## 8A. 3D Chrome/Liquid Metal
- Example: "The word 'VELOCITY' rendered in 3D liquid chrome. Highly reflective, melting metal aesthetic, dark studio background."

# 10. Abstract Concept Art

- Useful for backgrounds or creative inspiration.
- Focus on emotions, textures, and color theory rather than specific objects.
Example: "An abstract representation of 'Digital Serenity.' Flowing liquid metal textures, iridescent colors, smooth curves, ethereal and calming composition."

"Abstract" can be messy; subtypes give it a mathematical or physical structure.

# 10A. Generative/Algorithmic
- Example: "A complex abstract pattern of interlocking geometric wires. Mathematical symmetry, glowing light nodes, dark tech aesthetic."

# 10B. Organic/Macroscopic
- Example: "Abstract fluid art resembling cells under a microscope. Vibrant alcohol ink textures, gold leaf veins, organic flowing shapes."

# 10C. Glitch Art
- Example: "An abstract digital glitch. Sliced pixels, chromatic aberration, distorted color bars, high-energy tech chaos."

# 11. Website Hero Sections (UI/UX)

- Perfect for mockups or landing page inspiration.
- Define the layout (e.g., "Left-aligned text space") to ensure the composition is usable for designers.
- Example: "A website hero header for a luxury travel agency. High-quality photo of a Maldives resort on the right, clean white space on the left for text, modern and airy aesthetic."

## 11A.Minimalist SaaS
- Example: "A hero section for a software app. Massive white space, a single high-quality 3D icon on the right, clean sans-serif headline on the left."

## 11B. Immersive Video Background (Static)

- High-concept shots you’d see in Vogue or Harper’s Bazaar.
- Best Practice: Describe the "pose," "fabric texture," and "high-contrast lighting."
- Prompt Tip: "A high-fashion editorial shot. A model wearing a dress made of liquid gold, striking a dramatic pose. Hard shadows, minimalist concrete background, avant-garde style."

# 15. Food & Culinary Photography

- Making food look appetizing requires specific focus on "gloss" and "steam."
- Use "top-down view" (flat lay) or "shallow depth of field."
- Example: "A top-down flat lay of a rustic margherita pizza on a dark wood table. Fresh basil leaves, steam rising, glistening mozzarella, warm cozy restaurant lighting."

The lighting and angle define the "taste" of the image.
